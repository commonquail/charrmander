# Charrmander

This is a tool to assist with keeping track of the state of [Guild Wars 2][GW2] characters.

This tool was created primarily to assist with keeping track of which areas had been completed on which characters. The initial (unreleased) version was finished 2012-12-13. The following day [a patch][patch-12-12-14] was released that basically made that version redundant. It still provides a faster way to keep track of characters than constantly relogging, however.

## Features

* Individual area completion tracking
* Story choices
* Dungeon story completion tracking
* Crafting disciplines
* Drag & drop file opening
* Update check
* File type association
* Saves as XML with a different file extension
* Other things I can't be bothered to update this list with
